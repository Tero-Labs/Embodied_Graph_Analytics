# Embodied Graph Analytics

Graph and network analytics are mostly performed using a combination of symbolic expressions, code, and graph visualizations. 
These different representations enable graph-oriented conceptualization, analytics, and presentation of relationships in networks.
While many visualization designs are implemented for visual understanding of graphs, they tend to be designed for custom 
applications, and do not facilitate graph algebra. We define a design space of general graph analytics by summarizing 
the commonly used graphical representations (graphs, simplicial complexes, and hypergraphs) and graph operations, 
and map these elements to three brushes and some direct manipulation techniques.
